### Supervised Vs Unsupervised

>input to output learning.

#### Type of Supervised learning based on output

- Regression(can predict any number(infinite) as output)
- Classification(can predict only limited set of possible outputs like -0,1,2 or category/class two or more)

#### Type of Unsupervised learning

- Clustering(Group similar data points together)
- Anomaly Detection(Find unusual data points)
- Dimensionality Reduction(Compress data using fewer numbers)

### Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification

#### Linear regression Type of regression model

We have a training set with x as feature or input variable & we have y as output variable or target variable. m is number of training examples
Single training example is called as (x,y) and i<sup>th</sup> one is called a (x<sup>i</sup>,y<sup>i</sup>)
