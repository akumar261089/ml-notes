### Types of Machine learning

- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Recommender Systems
- Reinforcement Learning

### Supervised Vs Unsupervised

#### Supervised Machine learning

Supervised machine learning or more commonly, supervised learning, refers to algorithms that learn x to y or input to output mappings.
eg - Spam Filter, Speech recognition, machine translation(language), online advertising, self driving cars, visual inspection

#### Type of Supervised learning based on output

- Regression(can predict any number(infinite) as output) eg - housing prices
- Classification(can predict only limited set of possible outputs like -0,1,2 or category/class two or more) eg - Type of cancer

#### Unsupervised learning

Were given data that isn't associated with any output labels y and find something interseting in unlableled data eg - Google news

#### Type of Unsupervised learning

- Clustering(Group similar data points together) eg - Google news, DNA microarray clustering, customer grouping
- Anomaly Detection(Find unusual data points) eg - Fraud detection
- Dimensionality Reduction(Compress data using fewer numbers)

### Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification

#### Linear regression Type of regression model

We have a training set with x as feature or input variable & we have y as output variable or target variable. m is number of training examples
Single training example is called as (x,y) and i<sup>th</sup> example is called a (x<sup>(i)</sup>,y<sup>(i)</sup>)

##### Linear regression components

1. Training set
    - Features
    - Targets
2. Learning Algorithm
    - Function f
    x->f-> ŷ

Function as a straight line- leaner regression with one variable(univariate) f<sub>w,b</sub>(X)=wX+b= ŷ
where w&b are parameters

##### Cost Function

How well the model is doing. and tune parameters.
Cost Func : Squared error cost function
    J(w,b) =  1/(2m) * sum over i = 1 to m ( ŷ<sup>(i)</sup> - y<sup>(i)</sup>)<sup>2</sup>
    J(w,b) =  1/(2m) * sum over i = 1 to m ( f<sub>w,b</sub>(x<sup>(i)</sup>) - y<sup>(i)</sup>)<sup>2</sup>
